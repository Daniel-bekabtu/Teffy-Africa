# Teffy - Powering African Agriculture With Cardano like a fuel

Teffy is an innovative agricultural technology platform that connects farmers with potential investors via USSD, integrates GIS-based weather prediction, and deploys smart hardware probes to collect environmental data from soil and fences.

---

## 📌 One-liner

**Providing farmers with opportunities through technology.**

---

## 🧩 Problem

> 90% of farmers report difficulty attracting investors.

Access to capital is one of the largest barriers for smallholder farmers in emerging markets. Limited internet connectivity and lack of investor networks further widen this gap.

---

## 💡 Solution

**Teffy bridges the gap with a three-pronged solution:**

- 📱 **USSD-based platform**: Enables farmers to interact with investors without needing smartphones or internet access.
- 🌍 **GIS-driven weather prediction**: Provides real-time localized forecasts to aid decision-making.
- 🛰️ **Hardware probe**: Mounted on soil or fences to collect moisture, temperature, and other environmental data to support investment insights and precision farming.

---

## 🧭 Competitive Landscape

Teffy stands out through:
- Offline access via USSD (vs. app-only solutions)
- Integrated weather intelligence
- Real-time environmental sensing

---

## 📈 Market Opportunity

🌍 The addressable market is estimated at **$3.2B**, based on:

- Agricultural loss due to lack of investment and climate prediction
- Cost of alternative manual or outdated methods
- Teffy’s affordable pricing model aiming to cut traditional costs by 50%

---

## 💸 Business Model

Teffy generates revenue via:

- 🌾 **B2B licensing** for agri-fintech and cooperatives
- 💬 **Pay-per-transaction** via USSD for investors and farmers
- 📊 **Data subscriptions** for NGOs and governments
